# TO DO LIST 📝

- ⌨ `Integrate InputUtils`: Add support for the popular mod [InputUtils](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Rune580/LethalCompany_InputUtils/)
  - The mod adds an interface in the settings menu to change the hotkeys that mods like this create, which normally you can only change in the config.

- ⚡ `Conductivity Indication`: Add two separate ways that you can change the UI to indicate that you're conductive.
  - **HUD Conductivity**: A single indicator to the HUD that will only appear when you are holding a conductive item.
  - **Inventory Conductivity**: A indicator to the icon of any conductive items that are in your inventory.
  - The indicator used should likely be a lightning bolt. For icons the indicator will appear in a corner.
  - This feature would only run when on a moon that has lightning occurring. This would help performance.

- 💰 `Inventory Item Value`: Add the quota value to the items icons in your inventory. *(suggested by @paradox75831004)*
  - The quota value should likely be displayed near the top or the bottom of the icon.

- 🔧 `Custom Positioning`: Add the option to change the position of the HUD elements, in the config. *(suggested by @slashsgt)*
  - Changing a position could be changing the X and Y screen values and/or selecting from a list of predefined areas.

- 🎭 `HUD Styling`: Add the option to change the style of different HUD elements, in the config. 
  - Changing a style would be selecting from a list of predefined styles for each element.

- ❤ `Health Meter`: Add a health meter to the HUD, with custom positioning and alternative styles.
  - This could either be a bar meter or just a number value.

- 🧭 `Compass`: Add a compass, with custom positioning and alternative styles.
  - Fallout style compass. *(suggested by @slashsgt)*

- 😨 `Sanity Meter`: Add a sanity meter to the HUD, with custom positioning and alternative styles.
  - Knowing sanity is useful because a lower sanity you have, the more likely a girl or bracken will target you, and more.
  
***Note:** All features added will be Disabled by default.*
